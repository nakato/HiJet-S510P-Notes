### Notes

Oil filter hasn't changed since at least S100 (1994).
Oil filter is common to a lot of Toyota's.

### Sump bolt torque

Sump bolt on KF engine seems to be infamous for stripping out.

Some tips found online
* Clean drain bolt threads with parts cleaner.
* Clean threaded part of oil pan with parts cleaner.
  * But don't get it in the engine.
* Start the bolt by hand.

Early KF engines apparently used a short bolt that didn't go all the way through the pan.
This was apparently reworked at some point, and the OEM plug is now longer, so if it's stubby, consider replacing it.
Supposedly the thread length on the stubby is 9mm, and has been increased to 16mm.

Manual oil extractors are said to be effective on the KF engine.

### Fumoto

I installed a Fumoto F103SX at my first oil change.
The specs on the Fumoto F103SX call for 20Nm.
