# Battery

The OEM battery is a Flooded Lead Acid battery.  It conforms to JIS M42.


## Maintenance

As a flooded lead acid battery, this is a maintenance item.  If unsure how to
maintain a flooded battery consult proper flooded lead acid battery maintenance
documentation or ask your local auto-parts store or mechanic.

If plates are exposed above water level, special care will need to be taken.

Shaking the vehicle may help find the water level if it is difficult to see.

OEM battery high and low levels should be visible without removing cover, but
confirming this by removing the cover the first time is a good idea.


## M42

The battery is an `M42`, this is a JIS format number used for Idle-Stop batteries.

It is similar to non-Idle-Stop battery xxB20L.  Manufactures appear to say
M42 can be used where a 60B20L would normally be used.  I do not know if
using a 60B20L in place of a M42 is advisiable.


### Technical Information

| Depth | Length | Height (ex Term) | Height (w terminals) |
| ----- | ------ | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| 128mm | 196mm  | 202mm            | ~225mm               |

The following is sourced from the specs of various M42 batteries found for
sale. I do not know what the M42 spec specifies as a requirement, and the
specs from various manufactures may be exceeding the standard.

|   Sample |        CCA | Capacity |
| -------- | ---------- | -------- |
| A        | 400A       | 40Ah     |
| B        | ?          | 38Ah     |
| C [Note] | 500A (18c) | 40Ah     |
| D        | 400A       | 40Ah     |
| E        | 400A       | 40Ah     |

Note: Sample *C* with a 18c CCA rating is clearly a sub-standard product, because
that's not how CCA is measured, and I'm guessing this being used to hide an
inferior product.


### Australian Replacements

| Name                       | Model          | Notes  |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ------ |
| Energizer M42L EFB 400 CCA | EM42LEFB       |        |
| Delkor EFB SM42B20LEFB     | SM42B20LEFB    |        |
| AC Delco EFB SM42B20LEFB   | SM42B20LEFB    |        |


#### Emergency batteries

These might work.  But they're not optimal.
Group size NS40 is worth looking at.

| Name                       | Model          | Notes  |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ------ |
| Century NS40ZL MF          |                | Not Start-Stop |
| Century N65R               |                | Terminals backwards, might be too long to fit.  Requires moving cable mounts to avoid kinking positive lead. |
| SCA NS40ZL SMF             |                | Should fit.  The HALP I'm stranded battery.  Not Start-Stop.    |

### Lithium replacement


They're expensive...

| Name                       | Model          | Notes  |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ------ |
| MegaLife Battery           | MV-19L         | Start-stop? |
| PowerWorld LS40ZAL SSB Lithium Starting Car Battery | LS40ZAL |  |



### Warranty

These batteries seem most commonly warrantied for 2 years.  Some manufactures
offer 3 years if the battery is used in a vehicle that does not have the
Idle-Stop feature.
