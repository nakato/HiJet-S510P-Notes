# Daihatsu Hijet Jumbo S510P Manual 4x4 2023 Notes

The Daihatsu Hijet Jumbo S510P Manual 4x4 is a Japanese Domestic Market (JDM)
vehicle that is not available outside of Japan.  It is being imported to
various markets by enthusiasts.

As a JDM vehicle the manual presents two problems, is in Japanese and
references Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS).

1. Machine translation of the manual works well enough.
  * It's slow
  * It's wasteful to do twice
  * It requires good light
2. JIS can be converted into an equivalent standard
  * It may require finding Japanese sources and translating
  * It is thus time consuming
  * Shops are unlikely to know all required standards referenced in the manual.

This is thus a collection of information I've needed or think I may need in
the future quickly.  I welcome additional contributions of information.
