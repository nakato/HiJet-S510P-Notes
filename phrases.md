### Quality

Quality denotes varying quality of the terms.  If it's good, it's probably
been pulled from a webpage.  The other quality is "Word Salad", it might
work to turn up search results, but they're probably low quality.  It'd be
like trying to find something by searching for the terms from an auction-site
world-salad product listing, you just get more of those products.

For example, the "Hijet Truck" phrase is right from Daihatsu's product page.

"Drive recorder" came from initially finding "Dashcam" was nonsensical to
translate, and then using the term "camera front recording", which turned up
not much good.
I eventually find a good and proper product from this term, and after looking
it up I found it listed as a "Drive Recorder", and that phrase turns up high
quality search results.

### Purpose

By taking terms, especially proper ones, and smashing them together, you can
get some reasonable quality search results.  For example, taking "Hijet Truck"
and "Drive Recorder" and smashing them together I get blog posts and videos
of people installing these products in their Hijet trucks.
Being able to see the product used as well as how people are installing them
is extremely useful, and helps prevent breakage and mistakes.
